# Twitter Splash Screen : Motion Layout Demo

### Splash Screen
This is the first screen that comes to a user's view when an app launches. Splash screens usually display an animation of the logo but the more complex ones may also show some  animations based around the entire theme of the app.

### Motion Layout
* MotionLayout is intended to move, resize, and animate UI elements with which users interact, such as buttons and title bars. It is meant to add not only gratuitous special effects in an app, but also to create motions that help users understand what the app is doing.
* It bridges the gap between layout transitions and complex motion handling, offering a mix of features between the property animation framework, TransitionManager, and CoordinatorLayout.
* It inherently supports seekable transitions. This means that you can instantly show any point within the transition based on some condition, such as touch input. MotionLayout also supports keyframes, enabling fully customized transitions to suit your needs.
* One of the coolest things about it is that it's declarative, meaning you can describe any transitions in XML, no matter how complex.
